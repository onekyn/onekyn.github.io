  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm an Italian developer studying deep learning and information retrieval
    systems. Not an expert by any means but always willing to learn more and
    share what I discover along the way. My background is in computer science
    with a particular interest in how machines understand and process
    information.

  <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
  <p>My current focus is primarily on these interconnected areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mechanistic Interpretability</strong> — Understanding the inner
    workings of neural networks beyond the black box approach.</li>
    <li><strong>ML on Resource-Contrained Environments</strong> —
    Exploring efficient algorithms and model compression techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>Distributed Learning</strong> — Investigating approaches to
    train and deploy models across multiple devices.</li>
  </ul>
